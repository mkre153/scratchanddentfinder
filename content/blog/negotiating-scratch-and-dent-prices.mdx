Scratch and dent appliances offer serious savings—typically 20-50% off retail—but that doesn't mean the sticker price is final. With the right approach, you can often negotiate even deeper discounts.

## Understand What You're Working With

Before you negotiate, know the landscape:

<Callout type="info">
Most scratch and dent units carry full manufacturer warranties. The damage is cosmetic, not functional—which means you're getting a brand-new appliance at a discount.
</Callout>

- **Damage severity varies wildly.** A tiny scratch on the side panel (hidden once installed) is very different from a dented door front.
- **Inventory moves fast.** Popular models don't sit long, which affects your leverage.

## 7 Negotiation Strategies That Actually Work

### 1. Point Out Specific Flaws

Don't just say "it's damaged." Get specific:

- "This dent on the door is about 3 inches and visible from the front"
- "The scratch runs the full length of the side panel"
- "There's damage on multiple surfaces"

Specificity shows you've done your homework and gives the salesperson concrete reasons to reduce the price.

### 2. Know the Retail Price

Walk in knowing exactly what the undamaged version costs—at that store and competitors.

<PriceComparison product="Example: Refrigerator" retail={1200} scratchDent={900} />

Use this: "I see this retails for $1,200 and you have it marked at $900. Given the dent on the front door, would you consider $750?"

### 3. Ask About the Damage History

Questions that create negotiation room:

- "How long has this unit been on the floor?"
- "Has the price already been reduced once?"
- "Is this the only unit with this type of damage?"

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Units that have been sitting longer mean more flexibility. Managers want floor space for new inventory.
</Callout>

### 4. Bundle Multiple Items

Buying a washer AND dryer? A full kitchen suite? Your leverage increases significantly:

- "I'm looking at the refrigerator and range. If I take both today, what can you do on the total?"
- Bundle scratch and dent with accessories (hoses, installation, extended warranty) for package deals

### 5. Time Your Visit Strategically

**Best times to negotiate:**

- **End of month** — Sales teams have quotas to hit
- **Holiday weekends** — Stores run promotions and have more pricing flexibility
- **Weekday mornings** — Less busy, salespeople have more time to work deals
- **After new model releases** — Previous year's scratch and dent units need to move

### 6. Be Ready to Walk

The most powerful negotiation tool. Politely:

- "That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Thanks for your time."
- Leave your number: "If you can get closer to [price], give me a call."

<Callout type="savings" title="Walking Away Works">
This works especially well at smaller appliance outlets and local retailers who have more pricing control than big box stores.
</Callout>

### 7. Ask for Extras Instead of Discounts

If they won't budge on price, ask for value-adds:

- Free delivery (usually $75-150 value)
- Free installation
- Free haul-away of old appliance
- Extended warranty at no cost
- Accessories (ice maker kit, stacking kit, hoses)

Sometimes "no" on price means "yes" on extras.

## Where Negotiation Works Best

| Retailer Type | Flexibility |
|---------------|-------------|
| Local appliance stores | High — owners can make decisions |
| Appliance outlet stores | High — entire model is discount-focused |
| Big box scratch & dent sections | Medium — managers have some authority |
| Warehouse clubs | Low — prices are fixed |
| Online scratch & dent | Low — but watch for coupon codes |

## What to Say: Scripts That Work

<BuyerChecklist title="Negotiation Scripts" items={[
  "Opening: 'I'm interested in this [appliance], but I noticed [specific damage]. Is there any flexibility on the price?'",
  "Counter: 'I appreciate that. I'm trying to stay around [target price]. Is there any way to get closer, or maybe include free delivery?'",
  "Exit: 'I understand. Would you mind if I left my number in case the price changes? I'm definitely interested if we can make it work.'"
]} />

## Red Flags: When NOT to Buy

<Callout type="warning" title="Walk Away If...">
Even at a great price, walk away if damage affects functionality (dented drum, bent compressor lines), no warranty documentation is available, the serial number is missing, or the deal seems too good to be true.
</Callout>

## Bottom Line

Scratch and dent negotiation comes down to preparation and politeness. Know your prices, identify specific damage, and be willing to walk away. Most salespeople *want* to make a deal—your job is to give them reasons to justify a lower price to their manager.

The worst they can say is no. And even then, you might get a call back next week.
