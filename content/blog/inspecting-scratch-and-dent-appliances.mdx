    - "what to look for scratch and dent"
    - "buying used appliances tips"

takeaways:
  what: "Proper inspection of scratch and dent appliances involves checking cosmetic damage location, testing functionality, verifying warranty coverage, and assessing whether the discount justifies any defects."
  tips:
    - "Cosmetic damage on sides or back is often hidden after installation"
    - "Always request to power on the appliance and run a test cycle"
    - "Check serial numbers match documentation for warranty claims"
    - "Look for signs of water damage: rust, water lines, musty odors"

faqs:
  - q: "Can I get a warranty on scratch and dent appliances?"
    a: "Yes, many scratch and dent appliances retain their full manufacturer warranty. The warranty typically covers functional defects but not cosmetic damage. Always verify warranty status with the retailer and keep documentation."
  - q: "What's the difference between scratch and dent vs. refurbished?"
    a: "Scratch and dent items are typically new appliances with cosmetic damage from shipping or handling. Refurbished items have been previously used, returned, and repaired or reconditioned. Scratch and dent often offers better value since the appliance has never been used."
  - q: "Should I buy a scratch and dent refrigerator with a dented door?"
    a: "It depends on the location and severity. Small dents on the side panels are usually fine. Dents on the door could potentially affect the seal over time, so check that the door closes properly and the seal is intact. Negotiate a deeper discount for visible front damage."
  - q: "How much should I expect to save on scratch and dent appliances?"
    a: "Savings typically range from 30-70% off retail price, depending on the type and severity of damage. Minor cosmetic damage usually means 30-40% off, while more visible damage can mean 50-70% off."

Buying scratch and dent appliances can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars, but only if you know what to look for. A proper inspection takes just a few minutes and can prevent costly mistakes.

## Understanding Types of Damage

Not all damage is created equal. Before you start inspecting, understand what you're looking at:

**Cosmetic-only damage** includes scratches, dents, or scuffs that don't affect how the appliance works. This is the ideal type of damage — you get a fully functional appliance at a significant discount.

**Functional damage** affects how the appliance operates. This could include damaged controls, broken components, or compromised seals. Be cautious with this type.

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Value Finds">
The best scratch and dent deals are appliances with cosmetic damage on the sides or back — areas that will be hidden once installed. You get a like-new appliance at a fraction of the price.
</Callout>

## The Visual Inspection

Start with a thorough visual check of the entire appliance.

### Front and Visible Surfaces

Look carefully at:
- Door panels and handles
- Control panels and displays
- Glass surfaces (oven doors, microwave windows)
- Exterior finish quality

Damage here affects both appearance and potentially resale value. It should come with a deeper discount.

### Sides, Back, and Top

Check these less-visible areas for:
- Dents that might indicate rough handling
- Scratches or scuffs
- Signs the appliance was dropped

<Callout type="info">
Minor damage on sides and back is often acceptable since these areas are hidden after installation in most kitchens.
</Callout>

### Interior Components

Open every door, drawer, and compartment:
- Refrigerator shelves and bins
- Oven racks and broiler pans
- Dishwasher racks and spray arms
- Washer drums and dispensers

<BuyerChecklist title="Visual Inspection Checklist" items={[
  "Check all exterior surfaces for dents, scratches, and scuffs",
  "Open and close all doors — they should seal properly",
  "Inspect interior shelves, racks, and compartments",
  "Look for signs of water damage (rust, stains, musty smell)",
  "Verify all knobs, handles, and controls are present",
  "Check that the power cord is intact and undamaged"

## Testing Functionality

Never buy a scratch and dent appliance without testing it first. Most reputable dealers will allow you to power on the unit.

### For Refrigerators

- Plug it in and listen for the compressor
- Check that the interior light works
- Feel for cold air after 10-15 minutes
- Test the ice maker connection (if applicable)
- Open/close doors to verify seal

### For Washers and Dryers

- Run a short cycle with water (washers)
- Listen for unusual noises during operation
- Check all cycle selections work
- Verify the door/lid locks properly
- Test the drain function

### For Dishwashers

- Run a rinse cycle
- Check for leaks around the door seal
- Verify spray arms rotate freely
- Test the soap dispenser mechanism

### For Ranges and Ovens

- Test all burners/elements
- Verify oven heats to temperature
- Check that the door seals when closed
- Test any electronic controls or timers

<Callout type="warning" title="Red Flags">
Walk away if you notice any of these: unusual odors (burning, chemical), visible rust inside, error codes on display, or if the dealer refuses to let you test the appliance.
</Callout>

## Checking Documentation

Before finalizing your purchase, verify the paperwork.

### Warranty Status

Ask these questions:
- Does this appliance have a manufacturer warranty?
- What does the warranty cover?
- How do I file a warranty claim?
- Is there documentation I need to keep?

Many scratch and dent appliances retain full manufacturer warranties. The cosmetic damage typically isn't covered, but functional defects are.

### Serial Number Verification

Make sure the serial number on the appliance matches any documentation. This is essential for:
- Filing warranty claims
- Registering the product
- Verifying the manufacture date

## Price Comparison

Before committing, do a quick price check.

<PriceComparison
  product="French Door Refrigerator"
  retail={2499}
  scratchDent={1499}
/>

A good rule of thumb:
- **30-40% off** for minor, hidden damage
- **40-50% off** for moderate cosmetic damage
- **50-70% off** for significant visible damage

If the discount doesn't match the damage level, negotiate or walk away.

## Negotiation Tips

Don't be afraid to negotiate. Point out specific defects and ask for a better price. Most scratch and dent retailers expect some negotiation.

<Callout type="savings" title="Save Even More">
Ask about floor models and display units. These often have minor wear but come with even deeper discounts since they can't be sold as "new."
