When you're in the market for a new appliance, especially on a budget, you'll likely come across terms like "scratch and dent" and "refurbished." But what exactly do these mean, and how do they affect your buying decision? Let's dive into the differences and help you make a smart choice.

### What Are Scratch and Dent Appliances?

Scratch and dent appliances are brand-new but have some cosmetic damage. Maybe they got a little banged up during shipping or handling. The key point here is that the insides are as fresh and functional as any appliance you'd pay full price for.

- **Condition Grades:** These appliances are often graded. Grade A/B has minor blemishes, while Grade C/D might have more noticeable dings but still work perfectly.
- **Warranty:** Most scratch and dent items come with the full manufacturer's warranty, offering peace of mind.

### What About Refurbished Appliances?

Refurbished appliances, on the other hand, are typically pre-owned. They've been returned, repaired, and tested for resale. While they can be a good deal, they're not without risks.

- **"Discounted appliances lack warranty":** Scratch and dent often retain full coverage.
