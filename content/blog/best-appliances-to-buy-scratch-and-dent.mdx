Scratch and dent appliances can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. But some appliances are better scratch and dent buys than others. Here's the breakdown.

## The Best Scratch and Dent Buys

These appliances offer the best value when bought with cosmetic damage:

### 1. Refrigerators — Best Overall Value

<Callout type="savings">
Typical savings: $300–$1,000+ off retail price
</Callout>

**Why they're great scratch and dent buys:**
- Side and back panels are hidden once installed
- Highest retail prices = biggest dollar savings
- Cosmetic damage rarely affects performance
- Most damage happens during delivery (external only)

**What to check:** Make sure the door seals properly and the compressor runs quietly. Dents on door fronts affect resale value more than side dents.

### 2. Washing Machines — Hidden Damage Sweet Spot

<Callout type="savings">
Typical savings: $150–$400 off retail price
</Callout>

**Why they're great:**
- Top and sides are usually hidden in a laundry closet
- Simple mechanics mean cosmetic damage stays cosmetic
- Scratches on the lid don't affect wash quality

**What to check:** Run a quick cycle if possible. Listen for unusual sounds during spin. Check the drum for dents (rare, but affects function).

### 3. Dryers — Same Logic as Washers

<Callout type="savings">
Typical savings: $100–$350 off retail price
</Callout>

**Why they're great:**
- Paired with washers, so side damage is hidden
- Fewer moving parts than washers
- Dents don't affect drying performance

**What to check:** Verify the drum spins freely and heating elements work. Check the door seal.

### 4. Ranges and Stoves — Great for Built-Ins

<Callout type="savings">
Typical savings: $200–$600 off retail price
</Callout>

**Why they're great:**
- Sides are completely hidden when installed between cabinets
- Back panel is against the wall
- Only the front matters visually

**What to check:** Test all burners (gas or electric). Check oven heating and door seal. Avoid units with dented control panels.

### 5. Dishwashers — Almost Always Hidden

<Callout type="savings">
Typical savings: $100–$300 off retail price
</Callout>

**Why they're great:**
- Fully hidden under countertop once installed
- Only the door front is visible
- Side and top damage is irrelevant

**What to check:** Look for spray arm damage, rack condition, and door seal. Run a rinse cycle if possible.

## Appliances to Buy Carefully

These can be good deals, but require more inspection:

### Chest and Upright Freezers

**The catch:** These often sit in visible locations (garage, basement). All sides may be visible.

**Buy if:** Damage is on the back or bottom. Skip if the dent is on the front or lid.

### Over-the-Range Microwaves

**The catch:** Mounted at eye level, so damage is visible.

**Buy if:** Scratch is small or on top (hidden by cabinet). Skip dented doors or damaged control panels.

### Wall Ovens

**The catch:** Front-facing installation means door damage is always visible.

**Buy if:** Damage is on sides (hidden in cabinet cutout). Be picky about door condition.

## Appliances to Skip (Usually)

<Callout type="warning">
These scratch and dent purchases carry more risk or offer minimal savings.
</Callout>

### Countertop Appliances

Microwaves, toasters, coffee makers—the savings usually aren't worth it:
- Already inexpensive new
- All surfaces visible
- Savings often under $50
- No installation to hide damage

### Display/Smart Features

Be cautious with:
- Refrigerators with front displays (cracked screens)
- Ranges with digital control panels (button damage)
- Smart appliances with connectivity features

Cosmetic damage near electronics sometimes indicates handling issues that affected internal components.

### Used (Not Just Scratched)

Some retailers mix "scratch and dent" with refurbished or returned units. Know what you're getting:
- **Scratch and dent:** New, never used, cosmetic damage only
- **Open box:** May have been used briefly or demo'd
- **Refurbished:** Repaired and resold, may have had issues

Always ask: "Was this unit ever powered on before?"

## Damage Location Cheat Sheet

| Damage Location | Visibility After Install | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Back panel | Hidden | ✅ Always buy |
| Sides | Usually hidden | ✅ Great buy |
| Top | Often hidden | ✅ Good buy |
| Bottom/feet | Hidden | ✅ Always buy |
| Door front | Visible | ⚠️ Depends on severity |
| Control panel | Visible | ❌ Usually skip |
| Interior | Visible when open | ❌ Usually skip |

## How to Inspect Before Buying

### The 5-Minute Checklist

1. **Document all damage** — Take photos, note locations
2. **Check model number** — Verify it matches the price tag and spec sheet
3. **Test functionality** — Ask staff to plug it in
4. **Inspect seals** — Doors should close firmly with no gaps
5. **Get warranty in writing** — Most carry full manufacturer warranty

### Questions to Ask

- "Is this covered by the full manufacturer warranty?"
- "What's your return policy on scratch and dent?"
- "Has this unit ever been plugged in or used?"
- "How long has it been on the floor?"
- "Is there any damage I can't see from here?"

## Where to Find the Best Deals

**Best selection:**
- Appliance outlet stores
- Big box scratch and dent sections
- Manufacturer outlet stores

**Best prices:**
- Local appliance dealers (more negotiating room)
- End-of-year clearance events
- Post-holiday sales

**Best warranties:**
- Manufacturer outlets (factory-backed)
- Authorized dealers (full coverage)

## The Bottom Line

The best scratch and dent deals are appliances where the damage disappears after installation. Refrigerators, dishwashers, and washers/dryers are almost always great buys. Be more selective with visible appliances like wall ovens and microwaves.

Before buying:
- Know where the appliance will be installed
- Identify which surfaces will be hidden
- Test functionality, not just appearance
- Get the warranty in writing

Your wallet will thank you.
