### Peak Sales Periods for Maximum Savings

**Holiday Weekends:** Major holidays like Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, and Presidents' Day are golden opportunities for snagging those desired appliances. During these times, retailers are more inclined to offer substantial discounts, sometimes ranging from 35% to 40%. Combine this with their scratch and dent inventory, and you're looking at even heftier savings.

**End-of-Year Clearance:** As the year winds down, particularly from September to December, retailers clear out older models to make way for new releases in January. This period is ripe for deals, especially if you're not hung up on having the latest model. You might find prices slashed by $600 to $2,150 per unit!

### Early Fall Savings

If you're not in a rush, early fall (September to October) is another strategic time to buy. Most appliances, except refrigerators, tend to hit their lowest prices during this period. Retailers are keen on moving inventory before the holiday sales crush.

Bundle deals during these times can add $750 or more in savings, especially on washer/dryer sets.

### Common Misconceptions

There's a myth floating around that scratch and dent appliances don't come with warranties. Let's squash that now — they do, in fact, typically come with full manufacturer warranties. So you get peace of mind without the hefty price tag.

<Callout type="warning">
While timing your purchase is important, remember that inventory and specific deals can differ by location, so it's wise to check with local retailers.

### Timing Isn't Everything

While holidays and clearance periods are excellent times to shop, don't be disheartened if those windows pass you by. Retailers often run promotions year-round, and the savings can still be significant. It's all about keeping an eye on the market and being flexible with your options.

### Ready to Shop?

Equipped with this knowledge, you're now ready to time your purchase for the best possible savings. Remember, while new models are enticing, older models often provide a better deal during these key sales periods.
