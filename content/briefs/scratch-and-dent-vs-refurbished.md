## Research Brief

### Primary Question
What is the difference between scratch and dent and refurbished appliances, and how should consumers decide when buying discounted appliances?

### Target Reader
- Budget-conscious consumers shopping for discounted appliances
- First-time buyers confused by terminology (scratch & dent, refurbished, open-box)
- Anyone wanting reliable performance without hidden risks

### Why This Matters
- Understanding differences prevents costly mistakes
- Scratch and dent often better value than refurbished
- Warranty coverage varies significantly between types

### Authoritative Inputs
- The Furnace Outlet - Scratch & Dent vs Clearance vs Refurbished
- John's ABC - Open Box Appliances Guide
- My Budget Appliance - New vs Scratch and Dent
- Discount Appliance Center - Understanding Appliance Conditions
- Appliance Barn TX - Scratch and Dent vs Used

### Key Findings
- Scratch and dent appliances are brand-new/unused with only minor cosmetic damage from shipping, handling, or storage; internals match new units exactly
- Refurbished appliances are typically second-hand or returned units that have been repaired, tested, or had parts replaced
- Scratch and dent often come with full manufacturer warranty; refurbished warranties are usually shorter or limited
- Savings on scratch and dent can reach 40-60% off retail for near-mint condition
- Grade A/B scratch and dent have minor blemishes; Grade C/D have more noticeable damage but remain fully functional
- Refurbished units carry higher risk if refurbishment quality varies

### Common Misconceptions
- "Scratch and dent are used" - They're actually brand-new with cosmetic issues only
- "Refurbished means like new" - Usually previously owned and repaired
- "Discounted appliances lack warranty" - Scratch and dent typically retain full manufacturer coverage

### Scope Boundaries
This research explicitly does NOT cover:
- Brand-specific recommendations
- Pricing for specific models or retailers
- Detailed repair instructions
- Open-box comparisons unless directly relevant

### Risk & Caution Notes
- Don't guarantee specific savings percentages
- Note that refurbished quality varies by seller
- Emphasize checking warranty documentation for any purchase
