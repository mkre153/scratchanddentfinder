## Research Brief

### Primary Question
How do you negotiate prices on scratch and dent appliances?

### Target Reader
- First-time scratch & dent shoppers unsure if prices are negotiable
- Budget-conscious consumers wanting maximum savings
- Anyone uncomfortable with negotiation who needs scripts/frameworks

### Why This Matters
- Additional 10-25% savings possible beyond sticker price
- Many shoppers don't know negotiation is expected
- Right timing and approach dramatically affects success

### Key Findings
- 7 proven negotiation strategies work across retailer types
- Local/outlet stores have highest flexibility
- Specific damage callouts create negotiation leverage
- Bundling and timing visits strategically increases success
- Walking away is the most powerful tool
- Value-adds (delivery, installation) often easier than price cuts

### Scope Boundaries

### Risk & Caution Notes
