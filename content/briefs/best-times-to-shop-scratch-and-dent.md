## Research Brief

### Primary Question
What are the best times to shop for scratch and dent appliance deals?

### Target Reader
- Budget-conscious consumers looking to maximize savings
- First-time appliance buyers timing a major purchase
- Homeowners planning kitchen or laundry upgrades
- Landlords seeking deals for rental properties

### Why This Matters
- **Savings potential:** Timing can mean 30-50%+ additional discounts
- **Inventory availability:** Best selection during clearance periods
- **Stacking deals:** Holiday sales + scratch and dent = maximum savings
- **Budget planning:** Know when to wait vs. buy now

### Authoritative Inputs
- The Krazy Coupon Lady: Home Depot appliance sales patterns
- GoLoadUp: Best time to buy appliances guide
- UAKC: 2025 appliance buying guide
- TeeVax: Timing your appliance purchase
- Industry retailers: Bargain Supply, SoCal Outlets

### Key Findings
- Holiday weekends (Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Presidents' Day, Black Friday) offer 35-40% off with faster scratch and dent inventory clearing
- End-of-year (September-December) is prime time as retailers clear old models for January releases
- Scratch and dent savings range $600-$2,150 per unit with full manufacturer warranties
- Major retailers stack holiday sales with scratch and dent closeouts
- Early fall (September-October) sees lowest prices on most appliances except refrigerators
- Bundle deals (washer/dryer sets) can add $750+ in additional savings

### Common Misconceptions
- "Scratch and dent lacks warranty" — FALSE: Full manufacturer warranty included
- "You must wait for holidays" — FALSE: Promotions run year-round, but holidays offer deepest discounts
- "New models are always better deals" — FALSE: Older inventory during clearances is often cheaper

### Scope Boundaries
This research explicitly does NOT cover:
- Brand-specific recommendations
- Real-time inventory or current pricing
- Guarantees on future sale dates
- Extended warranty purchasing decisions

### Risk & Caution Notes
- Use "typically" and "often" when citing savings percentages
- Advise readers to verify current promotions with retailers
- Note that scratch and dent inventory varies by location
