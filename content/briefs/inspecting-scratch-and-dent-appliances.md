## Research Brief

### Primary Question
How do you properly inspect a scratch and dent appliance before buying?

### Target Reader
- First-time scratch & dent shoppers unsure what to look for
- Budget-conscious consumers wanting to save 30-70% on appliances
- Homeowners furnishing a new home on a budget
- Landlords seeking reliable appliances at lower cost

### Why This Matters
- **Financial risk:** Buying a defective appliance means lost money and hassle
- **Hidden damage:** Some defects aren't visible without proper inspection
- **Warranty gaps:** Understanding what's covered vs. what's not
- **Negotiation leverage:** Knowing defects helps negotiate better prices

### Authoritative Inputs
- Consumer Reports appliance buying guides
- Manufacturer warranty documentation patterns
- Retail industry standard return/exchange policies
- Appliance repair technician inspection protocols

### Key Findings
- Cosmetic damage on sides/back rarely affects function (often hidden after installation)
- Dents on doors/panels may affect seals and long-term performance
- Always test power-on and run through a complete cycle when possible
- Check for water damage indicators (rust, water lines, musty smell)
- Verify serial numbers match documentation for warranty claims

### Common Misconceptions
- "All scratch and dent items are the same" — Damage ranges from invisible to significant
- "You can't get a warranty" — Many items retain full or partial manufacturer warranty
- "The store won't let you test it" — Most reputable dealers allow testing
- "Cheaper is always better" — A deeper discount on heavily damaged item may not be worth it

### Scope Boundaries
This research explicitly does NOT cover:
- Specific brand comparisons or recommendations
- Electrical/plumbing installation requirements
- Extended warranty purchasing decisions
- Online vs. in-store purchasing strategies

### Upward Linking Targets
- Primary Guide: `/buyers-guide/`
- Store Directory: `/scratch-and-dent-appliances/`

### Risk & Caution Notes
- Do NOT guarantee any specific savings percentages
- Do NOT claim inspection eliminates all risk
- Use cautious language: "typically," "in most cases," "generally safe"
