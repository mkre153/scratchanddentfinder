## What Is Scratch and Dent?

Scratch and dent refers to brand-new appliances that have minor cosmetic imperfections—such as small dents, scratches, or scuffs—but are fully functional. These units are sold at 20-60% off retail prices because the cosmetic damage makes them unsuitable for sale as "new" merchandise, even though they work identically to retail units.

Key facts:
- Brand new, never used or owned — only cosmetic damage from shipping, handling, or display
- Fully functional with same performance, features, and energy efficiency as retail units
- 20-60% off retail prices, with discounts varying by damage visibility and location
- Often includes full manufacturer warranty — always confirm before buying

## Scratch and Dent vs. Other Types

| Type | Condition | Typical Savings | Warranty |
|------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Scratch and Dent | New with cosmetic damage | 20-60% | Often full manufacturer |
| Refurbished | Previously owned, repaired | 30-50% | Limited or seller warranty |
| Used | Previously owned, as-is | 40-70% | Rarely any warranty |
| Open Box | Returned, like-new | 10-30% | Usually full manufacturer |

Scratch and dent items are NOT used or refurbished. They have never been owned or operated by a consumer.

## Where Does Scratch and Dent Come From?

- Shipping damage during transport from manufacturer to retailer
- Warehouse handling scuffs and dings
- Floor models/display units with fingerprints, light scratches, or minor wear
- Packaging damage (damaged box but appliance is fine)
- Discontinued colors or models marked down to clear inventory

## Is Scratch and Dent Worth It?

Benefits:
- Brand-new appliances at 20-60% off
- Same performance as retail units
- Often includes manufacturer warranty
- Damage frequently hidden once installed
- Environmentally friendly (reduces waste)

Considerations:
- Limited selection — what's available varies
- May not find specific model/color you want
- Need to inspect in person when possible
- Some units sold "as-is" without warranty
- Visible damage may bother some buyers

Bottom line: Scratch and dent appliances are worth it for most buyers. If the cosmetic damage will be hidden (appliance against a wall, in a garage, or built into cabinetry), you get a brand-new, fully-functional appliance at a significant discount.

## Safety and Quality

- Scratch and dent appliances are fully functional and meet all safety standards
- Cosmetic damage does not affect performance, energy efficiency, or safety features
- They have the same expected lifespan as retail units
- They maintain their Energy Star ratings and efficiency specifications

## Warranties and Returns

- Many scratch and dent units retain full manufacturer warranty coverage
- Some retailers offer their own warranty or sell units "as-is"
- Always confirm warranty status before purchasing — get it in writing
- Return policies vary: many offer 14-30 day return windows, some mark items as final sale
- If covered by manufacturer warranty, functional defects are covered just like any retail purchase

## Inspection Checklist

Before buying, check for:
- Rust or water stains (signs of deeper damage)
- Unusual odors (burning, chemical)
- Damaged power cords or plugs
- Missing parts or accessories
- Verify the unit powers on
- Confirm model number matches the specifications you want
- Open/close all doors — they should seal properly
- Inspect interior shelves, racks, and compartments
- Check that all knobs, handles, and controls are present

Red flags — walk away if you see:
- Rust, water stains, or unusual odors
- Missing parts or damaged power cord
- Final sale with no warranty coverage
- Visible damage with less than 15% discount
- Error codes on display
- Dealer refuses to let you test the appliance

## Negotiation Tips

- You can often negotiate 10-25% additional savings beyond the sticker price
- Point out specific damage to justify lower prices
- Know retail prices before you walk in
- Visit at end of month (sales quotas), holiday weekends, weekday mornings
- Bundle multiple items for bigger discounts
- Be willing to walk away — it's your strongest tool
- If they won't budge on price, ask for value-adds: free delivery ($75-150 value), free installation, haul-away of old appliance, extended warranty, accessories

Where negotiation works best:
- Local appliance stores: High flexibility
- Appliance outlet stores: High flexibility
- Big box scratch & dent sections: Medium flexibility
- Warehouse clubs: Low flexibility (fixed prices)

## Best Times to Shop

- Holiday weekends (Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Presidents' Day): 35-40% discounts
- End-of-year clearance (September-December): Retailers clear older models, $600-$2,150 savings per unit
- Early fall (September-October): Lowest prices for most appliances except refrigerators
- After new model releases: Previous year's units need to move
- Bundle deals can add $750+ in savings, especially on washer/dryer sets
