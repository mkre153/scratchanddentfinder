# UX Copy Checklist

Quick reference for typography and copy decisions.

---

## Numbers & Stats

- [ ] Does it look like a ratio/score when it shouldn't? (`50/50` → `50`)
- [ ] Is the label redundant with the value? ("States: 50 states" → "States: 50")
- [ ] Will it break if the number changes? (`51/50` problem)
- [ ] Use `toLocaleString()` for large numbers (3659 → 3,659)

## Headlines

### Line Breaks (Strizver)

- [ ] **Break for sense** — where you'd naturally pause reading aloud
- [ ] **Break for balance** — avoid widows and extreme line-width differences
- [ ] Keep adjectives with their nouns
- [ ] Keep proper names on one line
- [ ] Never hyphenate headlines

### Strong Words (Wiebe)

- [ ] First words of each line should be the **most important** words
- [ ] Don't start line 2 with weak words ("the", "a", "by", "and")

### General (Butterick)

- [ ] Avoid ALL CAPS
- [ ] Prefer bold over italic for emphasis
- [ ] Keep headlines short — they're signposts, not essays

---

## Microcopy

- [ ] Can a first-time visitor understand it in <5 seconds?
- [ ] Is the action clear? (Button labels should be verbs)
- [ ] Avoid jargon — write for humans, not developers

---

## Trust & Transparency

- [ ] No claims that contradict business model
- [ ] Disclose paid/featured placements
- [ ] Use "verified" only if actually verified
